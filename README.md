# KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship

**Sprocket Central Pty Ltd**, client of KPMG, a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. 

Smith discusses KPMG’s expertise in this space (you can read more here). In particular, he speaks about how the team can effectively analyse the datasets to help Sprocket Central Pty Ltd grow its business.

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. 

However, in order to support the analysis, you speak to the Associate Director for some ideas and she advised that “the importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it drive company growth.”

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

**1.	Customer Demographic 
2.	Customer Addresses
3.	Transactions data in the past 3 months**
   
You decide to start the preliminary data exploration and identify ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data.

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is a long-standing KPMG client whom specialises in high-quality bikes and accessible cycling accessories to riders. Their marketing team is looking to boost business by analysing their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behaviour. 
The dataset was based upon the analysis on customer details and demographics.

It is important to keep in mind the business context when presenting your findings:

•	What are the trends in the underlying data?
•	Which customer segment has the highest customer value?
•	What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd ’s marketing and growth strategy?

What additional external datasets may be useful to obtain greater insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products?

Specifically, your presentation should specify who Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s marketing team should be targeting out of the new 1000 customer list as well as the broader market segment to reach out to.
